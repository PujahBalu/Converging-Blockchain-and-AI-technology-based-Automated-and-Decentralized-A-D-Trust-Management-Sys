## 💡 Key Concepts

- **Face Detection using AI**
- **Tamper-proof logs with Blockchain**
- **Decentralized access management**
- **Node trust scoring using confidence values**
- **Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake hybrid consensus**
- **Explainable AI (XAI) integration**
- **Scalable and personalized services**

---

## 🧪 System Features

- AI-driven detection and validation of individuals
- Blockchain to track confidence scores and prevent spoofing
- Asymmetric indicators for message reliability
- Real-time node-to-node communication for alerts
- Head node offset calculation using machine learning

## 🧱 Architecture Components

1. **AI (Face Detection and Scoring)**  
   Recognizes, classifies, and tracks faces with explainable reasoning.

2. **Blockchain (Trust Management)**  
   Stores records of confidence values, access logs, and node identities.

3. **Rating & Confidence Evaluation**  
   Nodes generate trust ratings for one another using:
   ```
   confidence = e^(-distance) + rating_history
   ```

4. **Minor Selection and Validation**  
   Unified Proof-of-Stake + Proof-of-Work algorithm with AI optimization.

5. **Explainability & Decentralization**  
   Improves trust and visibility into AI’s decision-making process.
