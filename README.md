Converging Blockchain and AI technology-based Automated and Decentralized (A&D) Trust Management System using Face Detection (https://rspsciencehub.com/index.php/journal/article/view/444)


Abstract:

Face detection systems are growing exponentially. Newly emerged technologies are also being involved in the management applications. But they had failed to compensate at least anyone of the essential aspects of the system such as scalability, security, personalization, etc. This paper presents a fundamental platform that provides the ways and techniques to intelligently use the integration of Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain in which AI is used to detect and recognize the face and Blockchain maintains the tamper-proof records. This convergence will provide a tamper-proof and rapidly working A&D access management system for a trust management system that can be used for attendance in an organization & for many other purposes.
